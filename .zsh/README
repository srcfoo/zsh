I've split my config like this:

 ~/.zshrc      - script that loads up functions and rc files
 ~/.zshenv     - used for non-interactive mode
 ~/.zsh/func   - all functions
 ~/.zsh/rc     - configuration split by topic

You'll have to take the files in this folder and install them
appropriately on your sytem.
